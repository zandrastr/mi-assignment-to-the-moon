# To the moon ðŸš€

A school assignment that focused on HTML and CSS.   
The project involved receiving a brief from a simulated client, which provided details on the design, images, and text required. My objective was to develop the webpage to meet the client's specifications.   
Through this assignment I gained valuable experience in working with a client's requirements and expanding my knowledge in HTML and CSS.
